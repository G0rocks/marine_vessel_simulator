# Marine vessel simulator
A simulator for marine vessels and their performance in various conditions.


## A note on other simulators
It must be addressed that this is not the first or only marine vessel simulator.
This project was originally started because the author could not find any scientific sailboat simulators online after searching for "sailboat simulator" on google and only seeing video games () on the first 2 pages. Then after getting this project to a potentially usable state (before validating the model though) tried searching again, this time searching for a "scientific sailboat simulator", finding a bunch of them and realising that the industry standard term is actually "weather routing" and not "sailboat simulator".

### Weather routing
General information on weather routing can be found here: [Weather routing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_routing)
Weather routing tools often use the following:
- [SailTimer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SailTimer)
- [Velocity prediction program - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_prediction_program)
- [GRIB - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB) og það er til crate í rust: [grib](https://crates.io/crates/grib)

### Scientific sailboat simulators (a.k.a. weather routing tools)
